HealthEase is a digital healthcare solution designed to provide hospital-like facilities at home, offering a
convenient and efficient way for patients to access healthcare services without the need to visit a hospital
or clinic. The system connects patients with a wide range of healthcare providers, including doctors,
diagnostic service providers, physiotherapists, and other medical professionals, ensuring comprehensive
care while maintaining the comfort, safety, and convenience of home treatment.
HealthEase leverages modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the
frontend, creating an interactive and responsive user interface. The backend is developed using
Python (Flask), providing efficient server-side processing, secure API management, and seamless
communication between the frontend and database. MySQL is used for reliable and structured
data storage, managing patient records, appointment schedules, medical reports, and service
provider details in a secure and scalable manner.
Health Ease is a comprehensive web-based Doctor Appointment Booking System developed
to bridge the gap between patients and healthcare providers. This system enables patients to
browse doctor profiles, view consultation fees, check real-time availability, and book
appointments through an interactive online interface. On the other hand, administrators can
manage doctor details, monitor appointment logs, and oversee system operations through a
dedicated dashboard.
By integrating a React-based frontend with a Python Flask backend and MySQL database,
the system ensures smooth communication, secure data management, and a user- friendly
experience. The project follows a structured architecture where the frontend and backend
communicate via REST APIs, ensuring scalability and reliability
